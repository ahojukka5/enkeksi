# Markdown-SQL evaluator

Package author: Jukka Aho (@ahojukka5, ahojukka5@gmail.com)

markdown-sql-eval takes a markdown-formatted input and executes the sql queries
found in it, and returns a markdown-formatted output where the results of the
sql queries have been added. Package can be used, for example, to create a
project documentation where SQL queries are automatically executed to get
example results in a dynamic manner.

markdown-sql-eval comes with a command line tool with a same name which can be
used to process markdown files efficiently.

Project is hosted in GitHub: <https://github.com/ahojukka5/gmshparser>.
